       ///< TS_SIZE and return Data. It may decrypt as many TS packets in Data as it

       ///< be done with Data pointing to the TS packet immediately following the
       ///< previous one.
       ///< 3. If the CAM needs to copy the data into a buffer of its own, and/or send
       ///< the data to some file handle for processing and later retrieval, it shall
       ///< set Count to the number of bytes it has read from Data and return a pointer
       ///< to the next available decrypted TS packet (which will *not* be in the
       ///< memory area pointed to by Data, but rather in some buffer that is under
       ///< the CAM's control). If no decrypted TS packet is currently available, NULL
       ///< shall be returned. If no data from Data can currently be processed, Count
       ///< shall be set to 0 and the same Data pointer will be offered in the next
       ///< call to Decrypt().
